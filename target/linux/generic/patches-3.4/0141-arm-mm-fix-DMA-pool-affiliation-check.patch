Subject: [PATCH 141/859] arm: mm: fix DMA pool affiliation check

The __free_from_pool() function was changed in
e9da6e9905e639b0f842a244bc770b48ad0523e9. Unfortunately, the test that
checks whether the provided (start,size) is within the DMA pool has
been improperly modified. It used to be:

  if (start < coherent_head.vm_start || end > coherent_head.vm_end)

Where coherent_head.vm_end was non-inclusive (i.e, it did not include
the first byte after the pool). The test has been changed to:

  if (start < pool->vaddr || start > pool->vaddr + pool->size)

So now pool->vaddr + pool->size is inclusive (i.e, it includes the
first byte after the pool), so the test should be >= instead of >.

This bug causes the following message when freeing the *first* DMA
coherent buffer that has been allocated, because its virtual address
is exactly equal to pool->vaddr + pool->size :
